# Governance

This document describes how Melodic Software projects are governed.

## Project Structure

Melodic Software operates as a **maintainer-led** organization. Decision-making authority rests with the project maintainers, with community input welcomed through issues, discussions, and pull requests.

## Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers have full access to repositories and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues and discussions
- Making architectural decisions
- Releasing new versions
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes code, documentation, or other improvements. Contributors:

- Submit pull requests following our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Participate in discussions and issue triage
- Help other community members

### Community Members

Anyone who uses, discusses, or engages with the projects. Community members:

- Report bugs and request features
- Participate in GitHub Discussions
- Provide feedback on proposals

## Decision Making

### Day-to-Day Decisions

Routine decisions (bug fixes, minor improvements, documentation updates) are made by individual maintainers through the standard PR review process.

### Significant Decisions

For significant changes (new features, breaking changes, architectural shifts):

1. **Proposal** - Open a GitHub Discussion or Issue describing the change
2. **Feedback** - Allow time for community input (typically 1-2 weeks)
3. **Decision** - Maintainers review feedback and make the final decision
4. **Communication** - Decision is documented in the issue/discussion

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes require:

- Clear documentation of what is changing and why
- Migration guide when applicable
- Sufficient notice period (announced in release notes)
- Version bump following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## Contribution Ladder

### Path to Maintainer

1. **Contributor** - Submit quality PRs, participate constructively
2. **Regular Contributor** - Consistent contributions over time
3. **Trusted Contributor** - Demonstrated understanding of project goals and standards
4. **Maintainer** - Invitation from existing maintainers based on sustained contributions

There is no formal timeline; advancement is based on demonstrated expertise and alignment with project values.

## Standards

We operate under clear standards:

- **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** - Community behavior expectations
- **[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Technical contribution standards
- **[Security Policy](SECURITY.md)** - Vulnerability handling

## Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| GitHub Issues | Bug reports, feature requests |
| GitHub Discussions | Q&A, ideas, general conversation |
| Pull Requests | Code review and contribution |
| Email | Private matters, security issues |

## Changes to Governance

This governance document may be updated by maintainers. Significant changes will be announced through GitHub Discussions.
