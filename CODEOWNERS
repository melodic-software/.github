# CODEOWNERS - Default code ownership for Melodic Software
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# These owners will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request
# that modifies code that they own. Order matters - later patterns take precedence.
#
# Note: This file provides organization-wide defaults. Individual repositories
# can override by creating their own CODEOWNERS file.

# Default owners for everything (fallback)
