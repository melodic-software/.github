## About Us

Melodic Software is a forward-thinking software organization dedicated to crafting high-performance, maintainable systems. We believe that great software is like a great symphony: every part serves a purpose, timing is everything, and the result is greater than the sum of its parts.

We specialize in **Modular Monolith** architectures, leveraging the full power of the **.NET ecosystem** to build robust solutions without the premature complexity of microservices.

## Our Tech Stack

We stay on the bleeding edge of the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Engineering Culture

We hold ourselves to high standards to ensure our codebase remains clean and adaptive.

*   **🏗️ Modular Monoliths**: We build vertically sliced features within a unified deployable unit, scaling to distributed systems only when necessary.
*   **🛡️ Compile-Time Guardrails**: We write [Custom Roslyn Analyzers](https://github.com/melodic-software/medley/tree/main/src/SharedKernel/SharedKernel.Analyzers) to enforce architectural rules *while* we code.
*   **🚀 Trunk-Based Development**: We merge small, frequent changes to `main` using feature flags and short-lived branches.
*   **🧪 Architecture as Code**: We use automated tests to verify layer dependencies and domain isolation.
