## About

Melodic Software is the independent software studio of **Kyle Sexton**, focused on crafting maintainable systems that scale gracefully. The studio specializes in **Modular Monolith** architectures, leveraging the full power of the **.NET ecosystem** to build robust solutions without the premature complexity of microservices.

Like a well-composed piece of music, great software requires harmony between its components — each module playing its part while contributing to a cohesive whole.

## Engineering Philosophy

High standards ensure the codebase remains clean and adaptive.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Orchestrated Architecture** | The choice of architecture depends on the size, scale, and scope of a project. Main applications use modular monolith, clean architecture, vertical slice architecture, or a combination of the three. |
| **Compile-Time Guardrails** | Custom Roslyn analyzers enforce architectural rules *while coding* — catching dissonance before it reaches production. |
| **Trunk-Based Cadence** | Small, frequent changes to `main` using feature flags and short-lived branches. A steady rhythm of continuous delivery. |
| **Architecture as Code** | Automated tests verify layer dependencies and domain isolation. |
