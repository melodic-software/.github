## About Us

Melodic Software is an organization dedicated to crafting maintainable systems.

We specialize in **Modular Monolith** architectures, leveraging the full power of the **.NET ecosystem** to build robust solutions without the premature complexity of microservices.

## Tech Stack

We build on the bleeding edge of the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Engineering Philosophy

We hold ourselves to high standards to ensure the codebase remains clean and adaptive.

* **🏗️ Modular Monoliths**: We typically build vertically sliced features within a unified deployable unit/module. The intent is to start with foundational modular boundaries that allow for a clean path towards a more distributed model (when it becomes necessary).
* **🛡️ Compile-Time Guardrails**: We write custom Roslyn analyzers to enforce architectural rules *while* we code.
* **🚀 Trunk-Based Development**: We merge small, frequent changes to `main` using feature flags and short-lived branches.
* **🧪 Architecture as Code**: We use automated tests to verify layer dependencies and domain isolation.
