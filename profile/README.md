# Melodic Software

### *We build software that sings.*

**Engineering-led. Quality-focused. Future-ready.**

Where code finds its rhythm — we craft maintainable .NET systems through modular architecture, clean patterns, and deliberate design.

## About Us

Melodic Software is dedicated to crafting maintainable systems that scale gracefully. We specialize in **Modular Monolith** architectures, leveraging the full power of the **.NET ecosystem** to build robust solutions without the premature complexity of microservices.

Like a well-composed piece of music, great software requires harmony between its components — each module playing its part while contributing to a cohesive whole.

## Engineering Philosophy

We hold ourselves to high standards to ensure the codebase remains clean and adaptive.

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Orchestrated Architecture** | We build vertically sliced features within a unified deployable unit. Like movements in a symphony, each module can be performed independently yet contributes to the complete composition. |
| **Compile-Time Guardrails** | Custom Roslyn analyzers enforce architectural rules *while* we code — catching dissonance before it reaches production. |
| **Trunk-Based Cadence** | Small, frequent changes to `main` using feature flags and short-lived branches. A steady rhythm of continuous delivery. |
| **Architecture as Code** | Automated tests verify layer dependencies and domain isolation. If it's not tested, it's not guaranteed to harmonize. |
